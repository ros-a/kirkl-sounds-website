					<h2 id="about-page-title">What inspires me.</h2>
					<p> I am a huge fan of arty, noisy, experimental
						sounds. I like to figure out how to make strange stuff interesting. Conversely I love to experiment
						with repetition, finding the little hooks and motifs that build a commonality, all those captivating
						riffs that hold onto familiarity as the sound world evolves. Some of my favourite composers are Eno,
						Dallwitz, Newman, Desplat, Wendy Carlos (to name a few).
					</p>
					<h3 id="about-page-title2">What's in the record box?</h3>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Of the last few years – </span>My most played albums would most likely be Parquet Courts' <i>Sunbathing Animal</i>,
						I fell in love with this band immediately, and this album in my opinion really captures their early sound
						perfectly. King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard's <i>Sketches of Brunswick East</i>, a fantastic collab between
						Gizzard and Mild High Club, every song is a testament to their incredible songwriting. Otoboke Beaver's <i>Itekoma Hits</i>
						just a manic, adrenaline ride of Japanese design!
					</p>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Of the last ten years –</span>
						Yo La Tengo's <i>May I Sing With Me</i>, although much older I think it’s one of my most played albums of most
						years. Foxygen's <i>We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace and Magic</i>, a great pastiche of the rock
						and roll sound with a sense of self indulgence. Ty Segall's <i>Emotional Mugger</i>, really could pick any album
						by Ty but this is on my most played most likely.</p>
					<p><span class="emphasis">Of ever –</span>
						Some big honourable mentions of yesteryears that I can never get enough of: Beck - <i>Stereopathetic Soulmanure</i>,
						Kinks - <i>Kinda Kinks</i>, The Velvet Underground - <i>White Light/ White Heat</i>, Can - <i>Delay</i>, Shonen Knife - <i>Burning Farm</i>,
						The Clash - <i>London Calling</i>, The Doors - <i>Strange Days</i>, ESG - <i>Come Away With ESG</i>; (and so on…)</p>
					<h3>That's me in a nutshell!</h3>
					<p>If you have any work for me, or questions about life and art and existentialism in the 21st century, or just
						a moment to spare between your mindless procrastinations feel free to drop me a message, my details will be on
						the <a href="contact.html">contact page!</a>
